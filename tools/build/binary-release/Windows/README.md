# Rakudo Perl 6

This is a pre-built package of Rakudo Perl 6, a Perl 6 compiler.

This package includes the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler and the module installer Zef.

## Running Perl 6

To run a Perl 6 program, open a command prompt and type

    C:\path\to\this\folder\bin\perl6.exe my_script.p6

or start a REPL by calling `perl6.exe` without an argument

    C:\path\to\this\folder\bin\perl6.exe

To add the relevant paths to your environment so you don't have to type the full
path execute the following script in CMD:

    C:\path\to\this\folder\scripts\set-env.bat

or when using Powershell (note the dot at the beginning):

    . C:\path\to\this\folder\scripts\set-env.ps1

## Installing modules

To install Perl 6 modules you can use the Zef module installer.

    C:\path\to\this\folder\bin\perl6.exe C:\path\to\this\folder\share\perl6\site\bin\zef install JSON::Fast

Modules will be installed into this Perl 6 package and will thus be available
even when moving this package.

### Native code modules

To install modules that require a compiler toolchain, you need to have the
Microsoft Visual C compiler installed. The freely available Microsoft BuildTools
contain that compiler. You can use the installer script

    C:\path\to\this\folder\bin\vs_build_tools_install_assistant.ps1

to guide you through the installation.

Alternatively you can install the BuildTools manually. They can be downloaded
[here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools).
You'll need to select the `C++ build tools` and recommended components.

The compiler is only usable in special Build Tools CMD / PowerShell windows.

To make use of the Build Tools in Rakudo using CMD:

- start a CMD window using Start Menu -> Visual Studio 2019 -> x86 / x64 Native
  Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019
- Execute \$scriptPath\set-env.bat

To make use of the Build Tools in Rakudo using PowerShell:

- start a PowerShell window using Start Menu -> Visual Studio 2019 -> Developer
  PowerShell for VS 2019
- Execute \$scriptPath\set-env.ps1

## Where to get help or answers to questions

There are several mailing lists, IRC channels, and wikis available with help for
Perl 6 and Rakudo. Figuring out the right one to use is often the biggest
battle. Here are some rough guidelines:

The central hub for Perl 6 information is [perl6.org](http://perl6.org/). This
is always a good starting point.

If you have a question about Perl 6 syntax or the right way to approach a
problem using Perl 6, you probably want the “perl6-users@perl.org” mailing list
or the
[irc.freenode.net/#perl6 IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6).
The perl6-users list is primarily for the people who want to use Perl 6 to write
programs, so newbie questions are welcomed there. Newbie questions are also
welcome on the #perl6 channel; the Rakudo and Perl 6 development teams tend to
hang out there and are generally glad to help. You can follow
[@perl6org](https://twitter.com/perl6org) and on Twitter, there's a Perl 6 news
aggregator at [Planet Perl 6](http://pl6anet.org/).

Questions about NQP can also be posted to the #perl6 IRC channel. For questions
about MoarVM, you can join #moarvm on freenode.

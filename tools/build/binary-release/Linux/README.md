# Rakudo Perl 6

This is a pre-built package of Rakudo Perl 6, a Perl 6 compiler.

This package includes the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler and the module installer Zef.

## Running Perl 6

To run a Perl 6 program, open a command prompt and type

    /path/to/this/folder/bin/perl6 my_script.p6

or start a REPL by calling `perl6` without an argument

    /path/to/this/folder/bin/perl6

To add the relevant paths to your environment so you don't have to type the full
path run the following script:

    `scripts/set-env.sh`

## Installing modules

To install Perl 6 modules you can use the Zef module installer.

    /path/to/this/folder/bin/perl6 /path/to/this/folder/share/perl6/site/bin/zef install JSON::Fast

Modules will be installed into this Perl 6 package and will thus be available
even when moving this package.

### Native code modules

To install modules that require a compiler toolchain, you have to have a
compiler installed.

- On Debian/Ubuntu based systems do `sudo apt-get install gcc make`
- On RedHat/Fedora based systems do `sudo dnf install gcc make`

## Where to get help or answers to questions

There are several mailing lists, IRC channels, and wikis available with help for
Perl 6 and Rakudo. Figuring out the right one to use is often the biggest
battle. Here are some rough guidelines:

The central hub for Perl 6 information is [perl6.org](http://perl6.org/). This
is always a good starting point.

If you have a question about Perl 6 syntax or the right way to approach a
problem using Perl 6, you probably want the “perl6-users@perl.org” mailing list
or the
[irc.freenode.net/#perl6 IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#perl6).
The perl6-users list is primarily for the people who want to use Perl 6 to write
programs, so newbie questions are welcomed there. Newbie questions are also
welcome on the #perl6 channel; the Rakudo and Perl 6 development teams tend to
hang out there and are generally glad to help. You can follow
[@perl6org](https://twitter.com/perl6org) and on Twitter, there's a Perl 6 news
aggregator at [Planet Perl 6](http://pl6anet.org/).

Questions about NQP can also be posted to the #perl6 IRC channel. For questions
about MoarVM, you can join #moarvm on freenode.
